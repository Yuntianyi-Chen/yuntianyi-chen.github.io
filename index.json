Existing studies learned regression models to predict the performance of potential configurations. Such learning suffers from the low accuracy and the high effort of examining the actual performance for data labeling. A recent approach uses an iterative strategy to sample a small number of configurations from the training pool to reduce the number of sampled ones. In this paper, we conducted a comparative study on the rank-based approach of configurable systems with four regression methods. These methods are compared on 21 evaluation scenarios of 16 real-world configurable systems. We designed three research questions to check the impacts of different methods on the rank-based approach. We find out that the decision tree method of Classification And Regression Tree (CART) and the ensemble learning method of Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) can achieve better ranks among four regression methods under evaluation; the sampling strategy in the rank-based approach is useful to save the cost of sampling configurations; the measurement, i.e., rank difference correlates with the relative error in several evaluation scenarios.","tags":["Regression Methods","Performance Ranking","Sampling","Software Configurations"],"title":"Regression Models for Performance Ranking of Configurable Systems: A Comparative Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"2f340145c25e0f6dc2c851371130f81d","permalink":"/talk/sate-2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-19T20:08:50+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/sate-2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SATE 2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yongfeng Gu","Yuntianyi Chen","Xiangyang Jia","Jifeng Xuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571480352,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571480352,"objectID":"bfd47e8dd9663ef7cccc4049092c304e","permalink":"/publication/multi-objective-configuration-sampling-for/","publishdate":"2019-10-19T18:19:12+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/multi-objective-configuration-sampling-for/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of performance ranking in configurable systems is to find the optimal (near-optimal) configurations with the best performance. This problem is challenging due to the large search space of potential configurations and the cost of examining configurations. Existing methods, such as the rank-based method, use a progressive strategy to sample configurations to reduce the cost of examining configurations. This sampling strategy is guided by frequent and random trials and may fail in balancing the number of samples and the ranking difference (i.e., the minimum of actual ranks in the predicted ranking). In this paper, we proposed a sampling method, namely MoConfig, which uses multi-objective optimization to minimize the number of samples and the ranking difference. Each solution in MoConfig is a sampling set of configurations and can be directly used as the input of existing methods of performance ranking. We conducted experiments on 20 datasets from real- world configurable systems. Experimental results demonstrate that MoConfig can sample fewer configurations and rank better than the existing rank-based method. We also compared the results of four algorithms of multi-objective optimization and found that NSGA-II performs well. Our proposed method can be used to improve the ranking difference and reduce the number of samples in building predictive models of performance ranking.","tags":["Sampling","Multi-objective Optimization","Software Configurations","Performance Ranking"],"title":"Multi-Objective Configuration Sampling for Performance Ranking in Configurable Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"• Presented a novel algorithm to predict the configurations’ performance and rank the configurations of software systems when we have little labeled data in one software system (target) but have enough data in another irrelevant software system (source).\n• This method is distinctive for it can be applied to any two configurable software systems even though they are from completely different fields and have different numbers of features.\n• Conducted a large experiment on 208 transfering pairs of 25 software systems.
